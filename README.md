# European Football Championship 2024

This is a parameterized report that showcases the benefits of
reproducing analysis at the click of a button. It makes it very easy to
update any work and alter any input parameters within the report.

This report is adaptable to the 4 semifinalists of the Euro 2024: Spain,
France, England, Netherlands. I will publish one report for every match
of the semifinals and final of the tournament on my
